        feature or function within, or extension of, the Services or the Autodesk

        republication) or reliance on Third Party Content or services.&nbsp; Autodesk
        does not test, screen, control, endorse, or accept responsibility for any such
        third-party Content or services (including, without limitation, errors or
        omissions) or the results obtained by using any Third Party Content or
        services, and any dealings between You and any third party in connection with
        such Content or services, including, without limitation, such third party's
        privacy policies, use of personal information, delivery of and payment for
        goods and services, and any other terms associated with such dealings, are
        solely between You and such third party. Autodesk may at any time, for any
        reason, modify or discontinue the availability of any third-party Content or

        Autodesk or third parties) may require assent to separate terms and/or payment
        of additional fees.</p>

        3.6&nbsp;<b>Communications Network.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;You will be solely

        to Autodesk's rights to delete Your Content upon expiration or termination of
        these Terms under Section 10.2 (Effect of Termination), Autodesk reserves the
        right to delete inactive accounts or purge related Content (and all backups
        thereof), without further notice and Autodesk Parties shall have no
        responsibility or liability for deletion or any failure to store Your Content.
        Autodesk may remove any Content that is posted to the Service without notice if
        it believes that such Content is excessive in size or exceeds reasonable (or
        Entitlement) storage limits.</p>

        identified in the Entitlements, and neither of the events described in (b), (c)
        or (d) above has first occurred, then these Terms shall terminate on the first
        anniversary of the Effective Date.&nbsp; Without limitation of anything in this
        paragraph, for all Service Offerings accessed as part of Subscription, these
